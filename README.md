The Invoice Management System has been upgraded to a MERN stack implementation. Key changes:

Backend:

MongoDB is used for storing invoice data.
Mongoose is added to define and manage the Invoice schema.
All CRUD operations are performed using MongoDB.
Frontend (to be implemented):

React will handle UI components such as InvoiceList, InvoiceForm, and InvoiceDetails.
Axios will interact with the backend API.
React Router for routing and hooks for state management.
Run npm install to install required dependencies (express, mongoose, cors, body-parser), and start the server with node app.js
